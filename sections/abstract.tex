A scintillator emits visible light fluorescence when ionizing radiation deposits 
energy during a scintillation event.
Single-photon camera designs for measuring scintillation events are limited by low 
levels of light collection.
We propose a kaleidoscopic scintillator geometry with specular surfaces to 
increase light collection in a single-photon camera while preserving the event's 
spatial information.
The kaleidoscopic geometry creates mirror reflections of the event in known 
locations for a given event location.
We introduce theory for imaging a kaleidoscopic scintillation event, 
a probabilistic model for the image of the event and its mirror reflections,
and an algorithm to estimate the event's location.
We confirm the presence of mirror reflections in accordance with the 
theory and validate the algorithm on experimental data.
The kaleidoscopic scintillator design may provide sufficient light collection to 
perform advanced radiation imaging techniques using a single-photon camera.
